# Fracture-Scan
# 🩻 Fracture Detection in X-Ray Images using TensorFlow 2.0

FractureDetect is an AI-powered web app that detects bone fractures from X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow 2.0. It enables users to upload X-rays and receive real-time fracture classification and bounding box visualization.

## 📌 Features

- Classifies X-ray images as fractured or not
- Optional: Detects and highlights fracture regions using bounding boxes
- Built with TensorFlow 2.0 and Streamlit
- Designed for educational and assistive healthcare purposes

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- TensorFlow 2.0 + Keras
- CNN architecture
- TensorFlow Object Detection API (for bounding box detection)
- OpenCV & PIL for image processing
- Streamlit for web interface
- Google Colab for training
- Annotation using LabelImg / Roboflow
